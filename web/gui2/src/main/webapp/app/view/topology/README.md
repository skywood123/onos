# Topology

This is the GUI2 version of the combined Topo and Topo2 views of the older version.

It uses Angular 7 components extensively. TopologyComponent is the starting point
for everything in it. 

This should all be moved to its own separate library once all debugging is done
(it is slightly more difficult to debug the code when in a separate library)
